# Unity-HDRP-Vioso-Template-Presenter
Unity HDRP template with Vioso integration for the Lablab studio.
Extended with a Presenter template with basic slide show, 360 player and 3D scene capability.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this project on your computer.

2. Download the Vioso calibration file [here](http://gofile.me/67omf/z4MSltLGp) and add it to the Assets/Plugins/Vioso/ folder.

## Testing the presenter template

Inside Assets/_Presenter/_Your Project thereâ€™s a scene file.

If you open and play that you should be able to use left/right arrow keys to go forward/backwards in 3 small scenes. Each scene demos a simple use case:

1. Scene 1: A basic slideshow on a black background. Use down/up arrows to go forward/backwards in the slides. There should also be general ambient sound playing. One of the slides should be a video with sound source. The source should somewhat sound like it comes from the position of the slide :) Would be nice if you could let us know. (I put the Audio Listener on the position of the camera rig)

2. Scene 2: A simple 360 player. Should have some sound playing too.

3. Scene 3: A 3D scene with a timeline that should automatically animate the camera rig to first fly forward, then sideways and then forward and vertically up.


## Working with the presenter template
1. Open the "Presenter Scene" file inside Assets/_Presenter/_Your Project.

2. Unfold the "---SETTINGS---" and "---SCENE---" objects in the scene hierarchy.

3. To create a new scene, add a scene prefab from "Assets/_Presenter/Prefabs" and assign it in the "Presenter Settings" object. The order in "Presenter Settings" defines the order the scenes will play in when using the Left/Right arrows. Anything nested under the scene prefab will be toggled on/off with the scenes object. You are not limited to slides or 60 videos. You can place anything there.



### Add a Slideshow
_Look in Scene 1 for inspiration_

The slideshow system is simple. It's either a 16:9 image texture or a 16:9 video.

**To add a slideshow to a scene:** 
1. From Assets/_Presenter/Prefabs, nest a "Slideshow" prefab under a "Scene" prefab.

2. Add slides under the "Add slides under this" element. The order of slides in the hierarchy defines the order the slides will appear when using the Up/Down arrows while the slideshow is visible.

**To add an image slide:**
1. Import a 16:9 image somewhere into Assets/_Presenter/_Your Project

2. From Assets/_Presenter/Prefabs, nest a "SlideShow ImageSlide" prefab under the "Add slides under this" element in a "Slideshow" prefab.

3. Assign the imported image to the "SlideShow ImageSlide" texture field in the inspector.

**To add a video slide:**
1. Place a 16:9 video in the Assets/StreamingAssets folder.

2. Open Assets/_Presenter/_Your Project/Video and duplicate the "Mandalorian Video" media reference and rename it. Then while having it selected, in the inspector change the Media Reference to be the exact same name of the video file in the streamingAssets folder.

3. From Assets/_Presenter/Prefabs, nest a "SlideShow VideoSlide" prefab under the "Add slides under this" element in a "Slideshow" prefab.

4. In the inspector for the VideoSlide assign the Media Reference you created before under Settings > Source > Media Reference.

### Add a 360 player
_Look in Scene 2 for inspiration_

1. Place a 360 video in the Assets/StreamingAssets folder.

2. Open Assets/_Presenter/_Your Project/Video and duplicate the "Mandalorian Video" media reference and rename it. Then while having it selected, in the inspector change the Media Reference to be the exact same name of the video file in the streamingAssets folder.

3. If your 360 video is in stereo, change the Stereo Packing setting to Top Bottom (It's usually this packing).

4. From Assets/_Presenter/Prefabs, nest a "360 Player" prefab under a "Scene" prefab.

5. In the inspector for the 360 Player assign the Media Reference you created before under Settings > Source > Media Reference.

### Add custom objects to a scene
As mentioned earlier, anything can be placed inside a Scene prefab and will be toggled On/Off when Left/Right arrows. That said we made a few tools:

**To add ambient sound to a scene**

1. Import a stereo sound somewhere into Assets/_Presenter/_Your Project.

2. From Assets/_Presenter/Prefabs nest the "Ambient Sound" prefab under a "Scene" prefab.

3. In the inspector, assign your imported sound to the Audio Source. The sound should sound like it's coming from all around.

**To add positional sound to a scene**

1. Import a mono sound somewhere into Assets/_Presenter/_Your Project.

2. From Assets/_Presenter/Prefabs nest the "Positional Sound" prefab under a "Scene" prefab. Place it where you would like the sound to come from.

3. In the inspector, assign your imported sound to the Audio Source. The sound should sound like it's coming from a specific position.

**To animate the camera movement**

_Look in Scene 3 for inspiration_

1. From Assets/_Presenter/Prefabs, nest a "Timeline Camera" prefab under a "Scene" prefab.

2. Animate the "Timeline Camera" position and rotation using whatever method you prefer, fx the build in Timeline system.

3. When the "Timeline Camera" changes position, it will automatically update the Projection Setup's camera rig.


### To debug the projection walls ###
By default, when you press play, the projection walls are disabled.

If you want to preview them while the scene plays, for debug purposes, select the "Presenter Settings" object in the hierarchy and toggle on "Render Debug Screens"





## Manual Projection Setup Usage
This should not be necessary for participants to follow, but if you need it, it's here.

### ProjectionSetup prefab

The projection setup for the Lablab studio is created in the ProjectionSetup prefab located in the ProjectionSetup/Lablab/Prefab/ folder.

![](https://github.com/Theoriz/Unity-HDRP-Vioso-Template/blob/main/Resources/Documentation/Screenshots/ProjectionSetupPrefab.jpg)

Add this prefab to your scene and disable other cameras in order to setup your scene for projection in the Lablab studio.

For example in the SampleScene, this projection setup as been added to the First person controller to replace the default camera of the First person controller.

### Game View setup

To work with the Lablab video projectors setup, the Unity application creates 3 full screen windows. The window on display 1 is for the wall outputs, the window on display 2 is empty as it is the monitoring display, the window on display 3 is for the floor outputs.

To previsualize this in Unity, you need to set your game view(s) to render the display 1 (for the walls) and 3 (for the floor), at a 3840x2400 resolution.

With this setup, you should see the following output in the sample scene :

### Using the studio model

In the ProjectionSetup prefab, the Lablab object is a 3D model of the studio for debugging purposes. It is enabled to help you visualize the physical space of the studio in your 3D world and validate the outputs. Once it is setup correctly, you can disable the Lablab component of the ProjectionSetup to see the final output of your scene.

### Merging into your own project (optional)

1. Copy the Plugins, ProjectionSetup and Resources folders from this project to your own project Assets.

2. Add the ViosoWarpBlendPP and TextureBlitPostProcess to the After Post Process section of the HDRP Global Settings.
